  - Change the code to accept parameters for MAX_DATA and MAX_ROWS, store them in the Database struct, and write that to the file, thus creating a database that can be arbitrarily sized.
  - Try reworking the program to use a single global for the database connection. How does this new version of the program compare to the other one?
  - Go research "stack data structure" and write one in your favorite language, then try to do it in C.

  - Write another sorting algorithm, then change test_sorting so that it takes both an arbitrary sort function and the sort function's callback comparison. Use it to test both of your algorithms.
